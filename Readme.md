# Nevo.API

This is the unofficial NEVO API.

NEVO provides data on the composition of foods expressed per 100 g of the edible part (i.e. meat without bones, vegetables without waste). In certain cases, the composition of some liquid foods may be displayed per 100 ml, if applicable this is indicated in the food name.
